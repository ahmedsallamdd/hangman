            <h2>How to play:</h2>
            <h4>The game has two modes: "Single player", "Multi player"</h4>

			<p class="instructions"></p><b>1. Single player mode:</b><br/>
			In this mode, you can choose from 4 categories: phrases, movies, songs and challenges.<br/>
			<p>Each of these categories has pre-defined lists of items related to that category.<br/>
			An item is selected randomly and creates spaces on top for the gusssed letters. Everytime you guess a letter right, its corresponding space is filled by that letter.<br/>
			you will get only 8 false trials or else you lose, so choose wisely.
			</p></p>
            
            <p class="instructions"></p><b>2. Multi player mode:</b><br/>
            This mode requires two players. The first one enters the name of a movie of their choice and clicks submit -while the other player is not looking ofcourse-, then the other player tries to guess the name of that movie.<br/>
            The maximum number of false gusses is also 8, just as the prevoious mode.</p>
